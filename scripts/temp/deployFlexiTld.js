/*
This script is needed to verify contracts that are generated through contract factory.

How to use:
- First deploy the Factory contract
- Then in deployTld.js replace the owner and factory addresses with the ones you want
- Then deploy the PunkTLD contract: npx hardhat run scripts/temp/deployFlexiTld.js --network songbird
- Go to arguments.js file and enter correct addresses (and other data if changed in deployTld.js)
- Verify it (see command line for the Verify command). Something like: npx hardhat verify --network songbird --constructor-args scripts/temp/argumentsFlexiTld.js <contract-address>
- After successful verification, every TLD contract created through the factory will show contract code. 
- The PunkTLD contract that you deployed using this script can be ignored (factory does not know about it). It
was only needed for the verification purposes.
